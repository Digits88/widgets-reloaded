# Widgets Reloaded

The default WordPress widgets don't offer much control over how they are output on the screen.  Widgets Reloaded seeks to correct this problem.

This plugin replaces many of the default widgets with versions that allow much more control.  Widgets come with highly customizable control panels.  Each widget can also be used any number of times.

## Features

The plugin overwrites many of the default WordPress widgets.  The following is the list of custom widgets the plugin offers.

* Archives
* Authors
* Bookmarks (Links)
* Calendar
* Categories
* Navigation Menu
* Pages
* Search
* Tags
